# Applied Data Science in python from Noob to Ninja

Applied Machine learning in python from Noob to Ninja using tools like pandas, numpy, Scikit-Learn, Keras, etc, built for use in the gdg bootcamp. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

Install and run Jupyter notebook with python 3
The requisites is defined in requirements.txt file

```
pip install -r requirements
```

### Running example

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

#### Open jupyter notebook and run the example
